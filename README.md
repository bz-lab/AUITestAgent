## üåü Introduction

AUITestAgent is the first automatic, natural language-driven GUI testing tool for mobile apps, capable of fully automating the entire process of GUI interaction and function verification. It takes test requirements written in natural language as input, generates and conducts UI interactions, and verifies whether the UI response aligns with the expectations outlined in the requirements.

![overview](assets/overview.png)

To enhance the performance of LLM-based agents in the domain-specific area of UI testing, AUITestAgent decouples GUI interaction and function verification into two separate modules, performing verification after interaction.

 In terms of implementation, AUITestAgent extracts GUI interactions from test requirements using dynamically organized agents to tackle the diversity of requirement expressions. Then, a multi-dimensional data extraction strategy is employed to retrieve data relevant to the test requirements from the interaction trace and performs verification.

## üì∫ Demo

### Using AUITestAgent in Meituan 
#### Task: View the rating of the first scenic spot in the scenic view, check whether its rating is consistent

### Using AUITestAgent in Facebook
#### Task: Send a post with content 'Hello everyone' and like it, check whether it is correctly displayed, and whether the like button turns blue

## üìù Evaluation

We evaluate AUITestAgent‚Äôs performance with two customized benchmark, [interaction benchmark](interaction.md) and [verification benchmark](verification.md), including 8 widely used commercial apps (*i.e.,* Meituan, Little Reb Book, Douban, Facebook, Gmail, linkedIn, Google play and YouTube Music). 

Our experiments show that AUITestAgent accurately completes 77% of interaction tasks, **significantly outperforms existing methods in natrual language commands to GUI interactions translation.** Additionally, it can detect 91% of injected GUI functional bugs with a false positive rate of just 3%.
Furthermore, unseen bugs detected from Meituan show the practical benefits of using AUITestAgent to conduct GUI testing for complex commercial apps.

For detail information, please refer to the [evalution results](evaluation_results/evaluation.md).

### GUI Interaction

We categorize the GUI interaction tasks into three difficulty levels, from easy to difficult, L1, L2, L3. For detail information, please refer to the [interaction benchmark](interaction.md).

Baseline: 
* [MobileAgent](https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent)
* [AppAgent](https://github.com/mnotgod96/AppAgent)


### Function Verification

For detail results, please refer to the [verification benchmark](verification.md).

![verification result](assets/verification.png)

Since AUITestAgent is the **first** to focus on natural language driven GUI function verification and there are no existing studies in this field, we constructed a verification method based on multi-turn dialogue using **GPT-4o as a baseline**.

## üßë Team introduction

AUITestAgent is joint work from [Prof. Zhou‚Äôs team](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~yfzhou/) at Fudan University and the Meituan In-Store R&D platform. We have long been dedicated to the field of AI for full-stack front-end technology. In addition to AUITestAgent, we have developed several other technological innovations, including [vision-ui](https://github.com/Meituan-Dianping/vision-ui), [Appaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611643.3613885) and [AutoConsis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3639477.3639748).
