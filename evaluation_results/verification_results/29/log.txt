  "reason": "The user's name 'Julius Volz' is consistent before and after clicking. On Page 0, the user's name 'Julius Volz' is displayed in the widget and in the list of user names. After the user taps on the avatar of the user who posted the first tweet, they are navigated to Page 1, where the user's name 'Julius Volz' is displayed in both the search bar and the widget with the verification badge. Therefore, the user's name remains consistent across both pages."
