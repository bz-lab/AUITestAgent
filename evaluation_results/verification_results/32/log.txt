Initially, on the Notification and post feed page (Page 0), the title of the first notification is 'Chris Fairley likes this'. After navigating to the Notification list page (Page 1), the title of the first notification changes to 'software engineer: 30+ opportunities in China'. Finally, on the Job listings page (Page 2), the title of the first notification is 'HANA Cloud DevOps Engineer - HANA Cloud Reliability Engineering Team'. This inconsistency indicates a problem with the notification titles across different pages."
